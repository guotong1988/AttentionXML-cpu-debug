Danzig 3: How the Gods Kill /SEP/ Danzig 3: How the Gods Kill. This limited edition release contains the CD for HOW THE GODS KILL and a rendering of H.R. Giger's surreal album a	group's highest-charting studio album. It was also the first Danzig album to be produced entirely by the group's singer/songwriter/leader Glenn Danzig, and would prove to be the last album to include original drummer Chuck Biscuits. Like its two predecessors, DANZIG III (which featured horrific cover art by H.R. Geiger), continued to broaden the quartet's fanbase, while maintaining the band's unmistakable stamp (slow and crunchy riffs, tales of sex and the devil, Danzig's Jim Morrison-like vocal delivery, etc.).		"Dirty Black Summer" is the album's standout track, as it deals with memories of Glenn Danzig's childhood, while other highlights include the eerie ballad "Sistinas," the buoyant title track, and the album-opening epic, "Godless," which is nearly seven minutes long. DANZIG III also proved to be one of the band's last album to stick to the group's original musical direction. Future releases like 1994's DANZIG 4 and 1996's BLACKACIDEVIL (the latter featuring only Glenn Danzig from the original band) experimented rather unsuccessfully with electronically sounds, a move that alienated Danzig's heavy metal audience.		Recorded at Record Plant and Hollywood Sound Recorders, Hollywood, California.		Danzig: Glenn Danzig (vocals, keyboards), John Christ (guitar), Eerie Von (bass), Chuck Biscuits (drums).

Rolling Stone (7/9/92, p.105) - 4 Stars - Excellent - "..Danzig embodies the best in contemporary hard rock while displaying an originality that transcends genres...Rock is alarmingly short of visionaries these days; Danzig is the genuine article.."

Acetal Machine Screw, Pan Head, Slotted Drive, #10-32, 5/8&#034; Length (Pack of 25) /SEP/ Acetal Machine Screw, Pan Head, Slotted Drive, #10-32, 5/8&#034; Length (Pack of 25). Machine Screws, also referred to as Machine Bolts, are often used with nuts or driven into tapped holes.  They come in a variety of head types and drive styles, but are generally available in smaller sizes.Acetal resins are characterized by their strength, stiffness, and hardness, and are stable over a wide range of temperatures, humidity, environments, and stress.  Acetal has a low coefficient of friction, and absorbs little water, minimizing the effect of moisture on its physical properties.  Acetal resists neutral oils, grease, petroleum-based fuels, many organic solvents, alkalis, oxidizing agents and acids, both organic and inorganic.  Compared to Nylon 6/6, Acetal is harder and has better water resistance, but lower impact strength and abrasion resistance.  Acetal is translucent off white in color.Pan head fasteners have a low, large cylindrical head with a high rounded top edge for higher tightening torques - these fasteners are often recommended to replace older head styles such as round, binding, or truss-head where possible.  Common applications for slotted screws include woodworking, although the drive style is not designed to be used with power drivers.  A threaded fastener's size name includes information about the major external diameter, followed by the threads per inch, which indicates if it is coarse or fine.  Fine threads are preferable when working with harder materials or when threading into a thin material.  They are also stronger in tension than coarse threads, and generally provide higher shear strengths.

This SmallParts spur gear is suitable for use in a variety of commercial and industrial applications, such as construction equipment, aeronautics, conveyors, and manufacturing equipment, among others.Spur gears, the most common gear type, have a circular or cylindrical shape with teeth bordering the outer perimeter and are used for transmitting rotational torque and motion between parallel rotating shafts. A spur gear's pressure angle (PA), diametral pitch (also called DP or pitch), and its material are important factors to consider when purchasing. Gears come in several types for use in different power transmission configurations and for different applications, including bevel and miter gears (for rotating shafts perpendicular to each other), change gears (to increase or decrease torque and speed), helical gears (for high rates of rotational speed), internal gears (where one gear is nested inside the other), rack and pinion gears (for turning rotational motion into linear motion), and worm gears (for perpendicular shafts in tight spaces and quiet operation). Gears are suitable for use in the agriculture, automotive, construction, mining, and packaging industries, and can be found in a variety of machines, including bicycles, automobiles, and elevators, among others.

This PTFE O-ring is white in color, has a durometer of 55D, a round cross-section, and is designed for use in a wide variety of sealing applications.    PTFE has excellent heat, fuel, and chemical resistance and is acceptable for temperature applications between -328 degrees F (-200 degrees C) to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). It can be used outdoors, with lubricants, hydrocarbons, acids, alkalis, detergents, alcohol, ketones, steam and refrigerants, and also has good electrical resistance. PTFE is vulnerable to high vacuum seals, low compression vacuum sealing flanges, and super-heated steam.   This PTFE O-ring has a shore durometer of 55D. Shore durometer is the hardness of a material, and its resistance to permanent indentation. A higher durometer value indicates greater resistance to indentation on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 indicating no indentation.   O-rings commonly provide a pressure and fluid seal between cylindrically shaped, overlapping mating surfaces and are commonly seen in engines, faucets, flanges, valves and various cylinders. They are circular in shape, with a round cross section and a hole in the center, similar to a doughnut. O-rings are available in various sizes, and can be ordered based on required nominal inside diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), and cross-sectional (CS) diameter.   This PTFE O-ring meets standards defined by Aerospace Standard AS568A, which is the Aerospace Size Standard for O-rings.

Irish Low Whistle /SEP/ Irish Low Whistle. The Irish low whistle, which is basically a bass version of the standard tin whistle, was introduced into traditional Celtic music in the late 1970s. Joe McKenna, who both plays and builds uilleann pipes, made his first low whistle from a mouthpiece he found in a London junkshop, a piece of brass tubing from his workshop, and a liberal application of duct tape. On tracks like "Colonel Fraser/Ril Gan Anim" McKenna shows the mellow, almost wooden flute-like tone of the low whistle is well suited to traditional dance tunes, while selections like his own composition "Echo's Calling" prove it is equally suited to more contemporary music as well. McKenna's accompanists include his wife Antoinette on harp and John Doyle--the guitarist from Solas--as well as tin whistle player Mary Bergin. The low whistle may be a newcomer to Irish music, but in the hands of players like McKenna it should soon take its place alongside "foreign" instruments like the fiddle and the flute that have long since become accepted in the kitchen and pub sessions where Irish music is at its most traditional. --Michael Simmons

Alloy Steel Set Screw, Hex Socket Drive, Cup Point, 7/16&#034;-14, 5/8&#034; Length (Pack of 10) /SEP/ Alloy Steel Set Screw, Hex Socket Drive, Cup Point, 7/16&#034;-14, 5/8&#034; Length (Pack of 10). Set Screws are often used for holding a pulley, gear, or other parts from turning relative to a shaft.  Alloy Steel is steel that has been alloyed with other materials to improve overall physical properties.  Steels are designated by a 4 number SAE Steel grade.  The first two digits indicate the primary materials used to form the steel.  The last 2 digits identify the percentage of carbon for the alloy (in hundredths).  Tensile strength ranges for the alloys typically used in these fasteners range from 170,000 to 180,000 psi (pounds per square inch), making these amongst the strongest of materials.  Hex socket drive systems are driven by hex wrenches or power tools with hexagonal bits.  Cup Point is the most common point type, with good holding capability.  A threaded fastener's size name includes information about the major external diameter, followed by the threads per inch, which indicates if it is coarse or fine.  Coarse threads are better when working with brittle materials; they are sturdier and are easier to thread and unthread compared to fine.  Coarse threading also allows for thicker coatings and platings.

The Annapolis Book of Seamanship, 3rd Completely Revised, Expanded and Updated Edition /SEP/ The Annapolis Book of Seamanship, 3rd Completely Revised, Expanded and Updated Edition. First launched in 1983, Annapolis remains the sailor's bible, a comprehensive chapter and verse guide to all aspects of seamanship from the simplest ABC's to the most advanced skills and latest electronics. And while much of the original edition has been left in dry dock to make way for the many changes on the water since 1983--like multihull vessels, satellite tracking, and the reality that while all ships remain "she," there is no longer the assumption that it's a "he" at the helm--Rousmaniere still emphasizes what he's stressed from the first tack: the importance of mastering sailing's fundamentals. This means knowing every inch of your boat and how to handle her, understanding the importance of safety on the seas and preparing for all emergencies, reading the weather, learning to navigate, knowing essential boat maintenance, and being aware of the traditions every sailor steps into whenever he or she sticks feet in a pair of topsiders. Clearly organized and presented, cleanly and smoothly written (given how much technical information he presents, Rousmaniere's prose is blessedly jargon-free), and thoroughly illustrated with photos and drawings, Annapolis is as essential as a good wind, perhaps the one volume no sailor should leave port without. --Jeff Silverman	Yachting magazine A volume that any sailor or would-be sailor simply must own.American Sailing Association The beauty of the book is that it is both a superb reference manual, which any sailor -- regardless of experience -- will want to own, and a readable, practical introduction to sailing for the beginner, A joy to behold. The most complete and best reference book on the sport that has ever been available.Chuck Hawley West Marine Products The Annapolis Book of Seamanship is thorough, well written, and nicely illustrated. Not just a repeat of tired old sailing methods of thirty years ago, it integrates the classic techniques (storm tactics. navigation) with the modern (Crew Overboard Recovery, modern anchors, and electronics). I highly recommend this book and encourage anyone to buy it if they want to improve their sailing skills.Sail magazine The Annapolis Book of Seamanship is about practically everything that has to do with sailing and sailboats.Yachting magazine [Rousmaniere's] chapters on sail trim and weather, in particular, are the best that I can recall reading.Sea magazine The piloting part is unusually thorough and understandable and could serve as a text all by itself. The individual chapters on sailing in heavy weather and handling emergencies are recommended reading for all who sail.Great Lakes Sailing Scanner magazine If you buy one book on sailing this year, this is the one of get.Sailing Canada magazine Mark Smith's line drawings are models of the kind -- clean, clear, and vital. It is not just one of the very best available.Tony Gibbs Dolphin Book Club News Once in a great while a book comes along which is so original that is stands outside normal comparison. The Annapolis Book of Seamanship is such a work....A remarkable achievement, a first-rate book in every way. It will almost certainly become -- in short order -- the standard to which succeeding volumes are compared.	John Rousmaniere, a devoted sailor since youth, has some 40,000 miles of blue water behind him, including ocean passages, nine NewportBermuda Races, and other major races in small and big boats.In 2013 the US Sailing Association honored Rousmanieres work in boating education, including The Annapolis Book of Seamanship, by presenting him with its Timothea Larr Award, which recognizes a person whose vision and guidance have made an outstanding contribution to the advancement of sailor education in the United States.He has spoken at more than 100 safety seminars and clinics across North America and served on the Safety-at-Sea Committees of US Sailing and the Cruising Club of America, the Bermuda Race Organizing Committee, and review panels of boating accidents. He is a member of the Cruising Club of America, the New York Yacht Club, and US Sailing, and serves on the selection committees of the National Sailing Hall of Fame and the Americas Cup Hall of Fame.He coordinated the US Sailing Associations Arthur B. Hanson Rescue Medal program, which recognizes mariners who make rescues. Johns videos include The Annapolis Book of Seamanship DVD Series. In 2014 Mystic Seaport presented him its W.P. Stephens Award for contributions to yachting history.Rousmaniere is a chronicler of the pastime he loves. He has written books about sailing history, yacht design, the Americas Cup, maritime photography, and storms. His book Fastnet, Force 10 was hailed as A narrative worthy of the best sea literature. Stuart Woods said about After the Storm, No one writes about the violence of the sea better than John Rousmaniere.Descended from a French soldier who fought in the American Revolution, Rousmaniere lives in New York City with his wife, Leah Ruth Robinson. He takes special pleasure racing in classic wooden boats, cruising across the Gulf Stream in more modern ones, and exploring marshes with his grandchildren in a small catboat.

American Dream, American Nightmare: FICTION SINCE 1960 /SEP/ American Dream, American Nightmare: FICTION SINCE 1960. "Hume shows an encylopedic knowledge of the period she covers as she surveys novels that exhibit common techniques, problems, and issues... This well-documented study, with its lengthy bibliography, will be valuable and engaging for students and scholars at all levels." -- Choice "[Hume] works inductively, considering roughly one hundred novels published between 1960 and 1990 in order to illuminate their thematic alliances... [This volume] succeeds because of Hume's sharp eye for detail. A master of the one-thousand-word critique, she is able to succinctly move thorugh dense novels without neglecting significant themes or ignoring pressing issues... I can think of no better text to introduce graduate students to the field, enlighten specialists working in earlier periods, or guide the general reader looking for a map through the terrain of contemporary fiction." -- Eric Schocket, American Literature  "A significant critical evaluation of contemporary American fiction that is sure to influence our understanding of the literature of the second half of the twentieth century... No one can claim to understand contemporary American fiction if he or she has not read and come to grips with the arguments in Hume's book." -- David W. Price, Southern Humanities Review  ADVANCE PRAISE "It's hard to think of a critical book as a 'page-turner,' but I literally read American Dream, American Nightmare as though it were a novel, so engaging did I find it." -- Brian McHale, author of Postmodernist Fiction "Brilliant and far-ranging, American Dream, American Nightmare will make its readers cheer, think, and sometimes squirm. Anyone who reads, studies, or writes about the American novel after 1945 (with particular emphasis on the 1960-90 period) must accept Hume's challenge to contextualize and historicize this large body of fiction. American Dream, American Nightmare is a stunning piece of work." -- David Cowart, author of History and the Contemporary Novel
Speed [VHS] (1994) /SEP/ Speed [VHS] (1994). Everything clicked in this 1994 action hit, from the premise (a city bus has to keep moving at 50 mph or blow up) to the two leads (the usually inscrutable Keanu Reeves and the cute-as-a-button Sandra Bullock) to the villain (Dennis Hopper in psycho mode) to the director (Jan De Bont, who made this film hit the ground running with an edge-of-your-seat opening sequence on a broken elevator). This is the sort of movie that becomes a prototype for a thousand lesser films (including De Bont's lousy sequel, Speed 2: Cruise Control), but Speed really is a one-of-a-kind experience almost anyone can enjoy. --Tom Keogh

CHAPTER IMine ear is open, and my heart prepared:The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold:--Say, is my kingdom lost?ShakespeareIt was a feature peculiar to the colonial wars of North America, that the toils and dangers of the wilderness were to be encountered before the adverse hosts could meet. A wide and apparently an impervious boundary of forests severed the possessions of the hostile provinces of France and England. The hardy colonist, and the trained European who fought at his side, frequently expended months in struggling against the rapids of the streams, or in effecting the rugged passes of the mountains, in quest of an opportunity to exhibit their courage in a more martial conflict. But, emulating the patience and self-denial of the practiced native warriors, they learned to overcome every difficulty; and it would seem that, in time, there was no recess of the woods so dark, nor any secret place so lovely, that it might claim exemption from the inroads of those who had pledged their blood to satiate their vengeance, or to uphold the cold and selfish policy of the distant monarchs of Europe.Perhaps no district throughout the wide extent of the intermediate frontiers can furnish a livelier picture of the cruelty and fierceness of the savage warfare of those periods than the country which lies between the headwaters of the Hudson and the adjacent lakes.The facilities which nature had there offered to the march of the combatants were too obvious to be neglected. The lengthened sheet of the Champlain stretched from the frontiers of Canada, deep within the borders of the neighboring province of New York, forming a natural passage across half the distance that the French were compelled to master in order to strike their enemies. Near its southern termination, it received the contributions of another lake, whose waters were so limpid as to have been exclusively selected by the Jesuit missionaries to perform the typical purification of baptism, and to obtain for it the title of lake "du Saint Sacrement." The less zealous English thought they conferred a sufficient honor on its unsullied fountains when they bestowed the name of their reigning prince, the second of the house of Hanover. The two united to rob the untutored possessors of its wooded scenery of their native right to perpetuate its original appellation of "Horican."*Winding its way among countless islands, and imbedded in mountains, the "holy lake" extended a dozen leagues still further to the south. With the high plain that there interposed itself to the further passage of the water, commenced a portage of as many miles, which conducted the adventurer to the banks of the Hudson, at a point where, with the usual obstructions of the rapids, or rifts, as they were then termed in the language of the country, the river became navigable to the tide.While, in the pursuit of their daring plans of annoyance, the restless enterprise of the French even attempted the distant and difficult gorges of the Allegheny, it may easily be imagined that their proverbial acuteness would not overlook the natural advantages of the district we have just described. It became, emphatically, the bloody arena in which most of the battles for the mastery of the colonies were contested. Forts were erected at the different points that commanded the facilities of the route, and were taken and retaken, razed and rebuilt, as victory alighted on the hostile banners. While the husbandman shrank back from the dangerous passes, within the safer boundaries of the more ancient settlements, armies larger than those that had often disposed of the scepters of the mother countries were seen to bury themselves in these forests, whence they rarely returned but in skeleton bands that were haggard with care or dejected by defeat. Though the arts of peace were unknown to this fatal region, its forests were alive with men; its shades and glens rang with the sounds of martial music, and the echoes of its mountains threw back the laugh, or repeated the wanton cry, of many a gallant and reckless youth, as he hurried by them, in the noontide of his spirits, to slumber in a long night of forgetfulness.It was in this scene of strife and bloodshed that the incidents we shall attempt to relate occurred, during the third year of the war which England and France last waged for the possession of a country that neither was destined to retain.The imbecility of her military leaders abroad, and the fatal want to energy in her councils at home, had lowered the character of Great Britain from the proud elevation on which it had been placed by the talents and enterprise of her former warriors and statesmen. No longer dreaded by her enemies, her servants were fast losing the confidence of self-respect. In this mortifying abasement, the colonists, though innocent of her imbecility, and too humble to be the agents of her blunders, were but the natural participators. They had recently seen a chosen army from that country, which, reverencing as a mother, they had blindly believed invincible--an army led by a chief who had been selected from a crowd of trained warriors, for his rare military endowments, disgracefully routed by a handful of French and Indians, and only saved from annihilation by the coolness and spirit of a Virginian boy, whose riper fame has since diffused itself, with the steady influence of moral truth, to the uttermost confines of Christendom.* A wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected disaster, and more substantial evils were preceded by a thousand fanciful and imaginary dangers. The alarmed colonists believed that the yells of the savages mingled with every fitful gust of wind that issued from the interminable forests of the west. The terrific character of their merciless enemies increased immeasurably the natural horrors of warfare. Numberless recent massacres were still vivid in their recollections; nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to have drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of midnight murder, in which the natives of the forests were the principal and barbarous actors. As the credulous and excited traveler related the hazardous chances of the wilderness, the blood of the timid curdled with terror, and mothers cast anxious glances even at those children which slumbered within the security of the largest towns. In short, the magnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of reason, and to render those who should have remembered their manhood, the slaves of the basest of passions. Even the most confident and the stoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was becoming doubtful; and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers who thought they foresaw all the possessions of the English crown in America subdued by their Christian foes, or laid waste by the inroads of their relentless allies.When, therefore, intelligence was received at the fort which covered the southern termination of the portage between the Hudson and the lakes, that Montcalm had been seen moving up the Champlain, with an army "numerous as the leaves on the trees," its truth was admitted with more of the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior should feel in finding an enemy within reach of his blow. The news had been brought, toward the decline of a day in midsummer, by an Indian runner who also bore an urgent request from Munro, the commander of a work on the shore of the "holy lake," for a speedy and powerful reinforcement. It has already been mentioned that the distance between these two posts was less than five leagues. The rude path, which originally formed their line of communication, had been widened for the passage of wagons; so that the distance which had been traveled by the son of the forest in two hours might easily be effected by a detachment of troops, with their necessary baggage, between the rising and setting of a summer sun. The loyal servants of the British crown had given to one of these forest fastnesses the name of William Henry, and to the other that of Fort Edward; calling each after a favorite prince of the reigning family. The veteran Scotchman just named held the first, with a regiment of regulars and a few provincials; a force really by far too small to make head against the formidable power that Montcalm was leading to the foot of his earthen mounds. At the latter, however, lay General Webb, who commanded the armies of the king in the northern provinces, with a body of more than five thousand men. By uniting the several detachments of his command, this officer might have arrayed nearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising Frenchman, who had ventured so far from his reinforcements, with an army but little superior in numbers.But under the influence of their degraded fortunes, both officers and men appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable antagonists, within their works, than to resist the progress of their march by emulating the successful example of the French at Fort du Quesne, and striking a blow on their advance.After the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated, a rumor was spread through the entrenched camp, which stretched along the margin of the Hudson, forming a chain of outworks to the body of the fort itself, that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to depart, with the dawn, for William Henry, the post at the northern extremity of the portage. That which at first was only rumor soon became certainty, as orders passed from the quarters of the commander in chief to the several corps he had selected for this service, to prepare for their speedy departure. All doubt as to the intention of Webb now vanished, and an hour or two of hurried footsteps and anxious faces succeeded. The novice in the military art flew from point to point, retarding his own preparations by the excess of his violent and somewhat distempered zeal; while the more practiced veteran made his arrangements with a deliberation that scorned every appearance of h...	      --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.

Diamonds Are Forever (James Bond) /SEP/ Diamonds Are Forever (James Bond). Probably the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England Raymond Chandler	      --This text refers to the 							Hardcover	 edition.	Ian Fleming (1908-1964), creator of the world's best-known secret agent, is the author of fourteen James Bond books. Born in London in 1908 and educated at Eton and Sandhurst, he became the Reuters Moscow correspondent in 1929. In the spring of 1939, Fleming went back to Moscow as a special correspondent for the London Times. In June of that same year, he joined Naval Intelligence and served throughout World War II, finally earning the rank of Commander, RNVSR (Sp.). Much of the James Bond material was drawn directly from Fleming's experiences as an intelligence officer. Later, Fleming became a consultant on foreign affairs for the London Sunday Times, by which time he had become far better known as the creator of James Bond.	With its two fighting claws held forward like a wrestler's arms the big pandinus scorpion emerged with a dry rustle from the finger-sized hole under the rock.   There was a small patch of hard, flat earth outside the hole and the scorpion stood in the centre of this on the tips of its four pairs of legs, its nerves and muscles braced for a quick retreat and its senses questing for the minute vibrations which would decide its next move.   The moonlight, glittering down through the great thorn bush, threw sapphire highlights off the hard, black polish of the six-inch body and glinted palely on the moist white sting which protruded from the last segment of the tail, now curved over parallel with the scorpion's flat back. Slowly the sting slid home into its sheath and the nerves in the poison sac at its base relaxed. The scorpion had decided. Greed had won over fear.   Twelve inches away, at the bottom of a sharp slope of sand, the small beetle was concerned only with trudging on towards better pastures than he had found under the thorn bush, and the swift rush of the scorpion down the slope gave him no time to open his wings. The beetle's legs waved in protest as the sharp claw snapped round his body, and then the sting lanced into him from over the scorpion's head and immediately he was dead.   After it had killed the beetle the scorpion stood motionless for nearly five minutes. During this time it identified the nature of its prey and again tested the ground and the air for hostile vibrations. Reassured, its fighting claw withdrew from the half-severed beetle and its two small feeding pincers reached out and into the beetle's flesh. Then for an hour, and with extreme fastidiousness, the scorpion ate its victim.   The great thorn bush under which the scorpion killed the beetle was quite a landmark in the wide expanse of rolling veld some forty miles south of Kissidougou in the south-western corner of French Guinea. On all horizons there were hills and jungle, but here, over twenty square miles, there was flat rocky ground which was almost desert and amongst the tropical scrub only this one thorn bush, perhaps because there was water deep beneath its roots, had grown to the height of a house and could be picked out from many miles away.   The bush grew more or less at the junction of three African states. It was in French Guinea but only about ten miles north of the northernmost tip of Liberia and five miles east of the frontier of Sierra Leone. Across this frontier are the great diamond mines around Sefadu. These are the property of Sierra International, which is part of the powerful mining empire of Afric International, which in turn is a rich capital asset of the British Commonwealth.   An hour earlier in its hole among the roots of the great thorn bush the scorpion had been alerted by two sets of vibrations. First there had been the tiny scraping of the beetle's movements, and these belonged to the vibrations which the scorpion immediately recognised and diagnosed. Then there had been a series of incomprehensible thuds round the bush followed by a final heavy quake which had caved in part of the scorpion's hole. These were followed by a soft rhythmic trembling of the ground which was so regular that it soon became a background vibration of no urgency. After a pause the tiny scraping of the beetle had continued, and it was greed for the beetle that, after a day of sheltering from its deadliest enemy, the sun, finally got the upper hand against the scorpion's memory of the other noises and impelled it out of its lair into the filtering moonlight.   And now, as it slowly sucked the morsels of beetle-flesh off its feeding pincers, the signal for the scorpion's own death sounded from far away on the eastern horizon, audible to a human, but made up of vibrations which were far outside the range of the scorpion's sensory system.   And, a few feet away, a heavy, blunt hand, with bitten finger nails, softly raised a jagged piece of rock. There was no noise, but the scorpion felt a tiny movement in the air above it. At once its fighting claws were up and groping and its sting was erect in the rigid tail, its near-sighted eyes staring up for a sight of the enemy.   The heavy stone came down.   'Black bastard.'   The man watched as the broken insect whipped in its death agony.   The man yawned. He got to his knees in the sandy depression against the trunk of the bush where he had been sitting for nearly two hours and, his arms bent protectingly over his head, scrambled out into the open.   The noise of the engine which the man had been waiting for, and which had signed the scorpion's death warrant, was louder. As the man stood and stared up the path of the moon, he could just see a clumsy black shape coming fast towards him out of the east and for a moment the moonlight glinted on whirling rotor blades.   The man rubbed his hands down the sides of his dirty khaki shorts and moved quickly round the bush to where the rear wheel of a battered motor-cycle protruded from its hiding place. Below the pillion, on either side, there were leather toolboxes. From one of these he extracted a small heavy package which he stowed inside his open shirt against the skin. From the other he took four cheap electric torches and went off with them to where, fifty yards from the big horns bush, there was a clear patch of flat ground about the size of a tennis court. At three corners of the landing ground he screwed the butt end of a torch into the ground and switched it on. Then, the last torch alight in his hand, he took up his position at the fourth corner and waited.   The helicopter was moving slowly towards him, not more than a hundred feet from the ground, the big rotor blades idling. It looked like a huge, badly constructed insect. To the man on the ground it seemed, as usual, to be making too much noise.   The helicopter paused, pitching slightly, directly over his head. An arm came out of the cockpit and a torch flashed at him. It flashed dot-dash, the morse for A.   The man on the ground flashed back a B and a C. He stuck the fourth torch into the ground and moved away, shielding his eyes against the coming whirl of dust. Above him the pitch of the rotor blades flattened imperceptibly and the helicopter settled smoothly into the space between the four torches. The clatter of the engine stopped with a final cough, the tail rotor spun briefly in neutral, and the main rotor blades completed a few awkward revolutions and then drooped to a halt.   In the echoing silence, a cricket started to zing in the thorn bush, and somewhere near at hand there was the anxious chirrup of a nightbird.   After a pause to let the dust settle, the pilot banged open the door of the cockpit, pushed out a small aluminium ladder and climbed stiffly to the ground. He waited beside his machine while the other man walked round the four corners of the landing ground picking up and dowsing the torches. The pilot was half an hour late at the rendezvous and he was bored at the prospect of listening to the other man's inevitable complaint. He despised all Afrikaners. This one in particular. To a Reichsdeutscher and to a Luftwaffe pilot who had fought under Galland in defence of the Reich they were a bastard race, sly, stupid and ill-bred. Of course this brute had a tricky job, but it was nothing to navigating a helicopter five hundred miles over the jungle in the middle of the night, and then taking it back again.   As the other man came up, the pilot half raised his hand in greeting. 'Everything all right?'   'I hope so. But you're late again. I shall only just make it through the frontier by first light.'   'Magneto trouble. We all have our worries. Thank God there are only thirteen full moons a year. Well, if you've got the stuff let's have it and we'll tank her up and I'll be off.'   Without speaking, the man from the diamond mines reached into his shirt and handed over the neat, heavy packet.   The pilot took it. It was damp with the sweat from the smuggler's ribs. The pilot dropped it into a side pocket of his trim bush shirt. He put his hand behind him and wiped his fingers on the seat of his shorts.   'Good,' he said. He turned towards his machine.   'Just a moment,' said the diamond smuggler. There was a sullen note in his voice.   The pilot turned back and faced him. He thought: it's the voice of a servant who has screwed himself up to complain about his food. 'Ja. What is it?'   'Things are getting too hot. At the mines. I don't like it at all. There's been a big intelligence man down from London. You've read about him. This man Sillitoe. They say he's been hired by the Diamond Corporation. There've been a lot of new regulations and all punishments have been doubled. It's frightened out some of my smaller men. I had to be ruthless and, well, one of them somehow fell into the crusher. That tightened things up a bit. But I've had to pay more. An extra ten per cent. And they're still not satisfied. One of these days those security people are going to get one of my middlemen. And you know these black swine. They can't stand a real beating.' He looked swiftly into the pilot's eyes and then away again. 'For the matter of that I doubt if anyone could stand the sjambok. Not even me.'   'So?' said the pilot. He paused. 'Do you want me to pass this threat back to ABC?'   'I'm not threatening anyone,' said the other man hastily.' I just want them to know that it's getting tough. They must know it themselves. They must know about this man Sillitoe. And look what the Chairman said in our annual report. He said that our mines were losing more than two million pounds a year through smug-gling and IDE and that it was up to the government to stop it. And what does that mean? It means "stop me"!'   'And me,' said the pilot mildly. 'So what do you want? More money?'   'Yes,' said the other man stubbornly. 'I want a bigger cut. Twenty per cent more or I'll have to quit.' He t...	      --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.

Brass Machine Screw, Pan Head, Phillips Drive, #10-32, 1-1/2&#034; Length (Pack of 100) /SEP/ Brass Machine Screw, Pan Head, Phillips Drive, #10-32, 1-1/2&#034; Length (Pack of 100). Machine Screws, also referred to as Machine Bolts, are often used with nuts or driven into tapped holes.  They come in a variety of head types and drive styles, but are generally available in smaller sizes.Brass is rust proof, corrosion resistant and polishes to a rich, golden color.  Brass is easily soldered and brazed and accepts plating readily.  The typical composition is 70% Copper and 30% Zinc.  Strength increases with a higher percentage of Zinc.Pan head fasteners have a low, large cylindrical head with a high rounded top edge for higher tightening torques - these fasteners are often recommended to replace older head styles such as round, binding, or truss-head where possible.  The Phillips drive style was originally designed so that the driver would slip out under extreme torque, preventing over-tightening and damage to the fastener or the material.  A threaded fastener's size name includes information about the major external diameter, followed by the threads per inch, which indicates if it is coarse or fine.  Fine threads are preferable when working with harder materials or when threading into a thin material.  They are also stronger in tension than coarse threads, and generally provide higher shear strengths.

-147 Buna O-Ring, 70A Durometer, Black, 2-11/16&#034; ID, 2-7/8&#034; OD, 3/32&#034; Width (Pack of 10) /SEP/ -147 Buna O-Ring, 70A Durometer, Black, 2-11/16&#034; ID, 2-7/8&#034; OD, 3/32&#034; Width (Pack of 10). This O-ring is made of black Buna-nitrile, is round in cross-section, has a durometer of 70A, and is designed for use in a wide variety of sealing applications.    Buna-nitrile can have high tensile strength, and abrasion, tear, and compression set resistance. It can be used in temperatures between -30 degrees F (-34 degrees C) to 250 degrees F (121 degrees C), and is compatible for use with petroleum, HFA, HFB and HFC fluids, vegetable oil, alcohol, acids and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Buna-nitrile is vulnerable to acetone, ethers, esters, ozone, sunlight and weathering and should therefore not be used in ozone-generating electric motors, welding equipment, or in applications with exposure to UV light.   This Buna O-ring has a shore durometer of 70A. Shore durometer is the hardness of a material, and its resistance to permanent indentation. A higher durometer value indicates greater resistance to indentation on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 indicating no indentation.   O-rings commonly provide a pressure and fluid seal between cylindrically shaped, overlapping mating surfaces and are commonly seen in engines, faucets, flanges, valves, and various cylinders. They are circular in shape, with a round cross section, and a hole in the center, similar to a doughnut. O-rings are available in various sizes, and can be ordered based on required nominal inside diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), and cross-sectional (CS) diameter.   These Buna-nitrile O-rings meet standards defined by Aerospace Standard AS568A, which is the Aerospace Size Standard for O-rings.
Braveheart (1995) /SEP/ Braveheart (1995). A stupendous historical saga, Braveheart won five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for star Mel Gibson. He plays William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish commoner who unites the various clans against a cruel English King, Edward the Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan). The scenes of hand-to-hand combat are brutally violent, but they never glorify the bloodshed. There is such enormous scope to this story that it works on a smaller, more personal scale as well, essaying love and loss, patriotism and passion. Extremely moving, it reveals Gibson as a multitalented performer and remarkable director with an eye for detail and an understanding of human emotion. (His first directorial effort was 1993's Man Without a Face.) The film is nearly three hours long and includes several plot tangents, yet is never dull. This movie resonates long after you have seen it, both for its visual beauty and for its powerful story. --Rochelle O'Gorman

Black Oxide Alloy Steel Set Screw, Hex Socket Drive, Cup Point, 5/16&#034;-24, 5/8&#034; Length (Pack of 100) /SEP/ Black Oxide Alloy Steel Set Screw, Hex Socket Drive, Cup Point, 5/16&#034;-24, 5/8&#034; Length (Pack of 100). Set Screws are often used for holding a pulley, gear, or other parts from turning relative to a shaft.  Alloy Steel is steel that has been alloyed with other materials to improve overall physical properties.  Steels are designated by a 4 number SAE Steel grade.  The first two digits indicate the primary materials used to form the steel.  The last 2 digits identify the percentage of carbon for the alloy (in hundredths).  Tensile strength ranges for the alloys typically used in these fasteners range from 170,000 to 180,000 psi (pounds per square inch), making these amongst the strongest of materials.  Hex socket drive systems are driven by hex wrenches or power tools with hexagonal bits.  Cup Point is the most common point type, with good holding capability.  A threaded fastener's size name includes information about the major external diameter, followed by the threads per inch, which indicates if it is coarse or fine.  Fine threads are preferable when working with harder materials or when threading into a thin material.  They are also stronger in tension than coarse threads, and generally provide higher shear strengths.
Infested (2002) /SEP/ Infested (2002). If a cross between Night of the Living Dead, The Big Chill, and countless killer bug movies sounds like your idea of movie magic, then director John Olson's Infested is for you. On the other hand, if compelling storytelling, convincing special effects, and good acting are among your criteria for a positive cinematic experience, well... When a gang of thirtysomethings gather for the funeral of one of their own, things soon go really, really wrong when swarms of extremely nasty flies start using our heroes as hosts, eating them from the inside out (which means we don't actually see it happen--a good move for a low-budget film!). Where did these infernal winged wonders come from? What's their agenda? Infested eventually provides answers, but it ain't worth the wait. Indeed, movies like this only make you long for the guileless camp of '50s sci-fi, and that's no small feat. --Sam Graham	After the funeral of an old friend, the old gang gathers for a weekend of emotional reflection, but it all starts to go horribly wrong when they discover an infestation of mutant flies. The flies don t just sting, they fly into their victim s mouths and breed, inhabiting and controlling their bodies. All they can rely on is ingenuity, the will to survive, and a case of bug spray that s fast running out.

Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Diesel 10 /SEP/ Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Diesel 10. Good is always balanced with evil, and in the case of the movie  Thomas and the Magic Railroad, Diesel 10 is a truly icky bad  guy. Teamed with sidekicks Splatter and Dodge, Diesel 10 is a renegade  engine on the Island of Sodor out to destroy the harmony of Sir Topham  Hatt's Railway. To intensify this train's nastiness, Diesel 10--on a  scale of 1 to 10--is rated 10 for devious deeds and brutal strength.  Measuring 4.25 inches long, Diesel 10 has two sets of wheels that  swivel, helping this extra-long train negotiate the tracks. Equipped  with a mischievous expression, Diesel 10 is pea green and--just like in  the movie--has a claw-like arm on top to help create havoc. As with all  Thomas the Tank Engine Learning Curve products, Diesel 10 is made of  hard maple and has two magnets on each end to allow your child to  expand their set. --Diane Tuman	Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Diesel 10
Talking Heads /SEP/ Talking Heads. Talking Heads' 30th anniversary is commemorated in typically artful style here, sonically upgrading their eight, era-defining albums via bonus-packed Dual Discs and encasing them in a molded white plastic box intricately embossed with the band's song titles. Each disc contains complete album tracks and bonus cuts remastered in High Resolution Stereo on its CD side, while the DVD programming on the flip offers up the audio tracks in expansive new 5.1 Surround Sound mixes, with all of the sonic upgrading personally supervised by Jerry Harrison. Those long overdue audio improvements alone would make it an attractive set, but fans of the band will find its wealth of bonus music (various B-sides and previously unreleased outtakes) and video (including a number of rare live clips seeing their first release here) supplements equally intriguing.       Bonus musical highlights include four rhythmically-charged, unfinished Remain in Light outtakes (including one that eventually evolved into the band's signature "Once in a Lifetime") that allow insightful glimpses into Eno's innovative production techniques on the album, alternate versions of "Cities," "Life During Wartime" and "Mind" from Fear of Music, a countrified version of "Thank You For Sending Me an Angel" from More Songs About.. and a strangely muted early version of another Heads staple, Speaking in Tongue's "Burning Down the House." An early demo of "And She Was" from Little Creatures demostrates that the whole of a glorius pop song can be the assembly of its simple parts. While the additional visual materials (especially the raw early performance clips) are a welcome addition to the Heads' canon, they're also something of a tradeoff: a few of the band's videos are conspicuously absent, including Remain in Light's "Once in a Lifetime." But overlooking a couple of the band's better known promotional moments in favor of revealing new musical treasures and vastly improved, state-of-the-art audio scarcely blunts the appeal of this rewarding career overview. -- Jerry McCulley	The first complete artist catalog released on DualDisc! This specially packed boxed set contains all eight of Talking Heads' studio albums, expanded and remastered as two-sided Dual Discs featuring audiophile DVD-A sound, rare and previously unreleased material, and video tracks. Packaging includes an outer white molded plastic box with raised song titles, housing eight individually packaged white jewel cases, each containing liner notes, rare photos, and song-inspired art pieces.

160 Silicone O-Ring, 70A Durometer, Red, 5-1/4&#034; ID, 5-7/16&#034; OD, 3/32&#034; Width (Pack of 25) /SEP/ 160 Silicone O-Ring, 70A Durometer, Red, 5-1/4&#034; ID, 5-7/16&#034; OD, 3/32&#034; Width (Pack of 25). This silicone O-ring is red in color, round in shape, has a durometer of 7OA, and is designed for use in a wide variety of sealing applications.    Silicone is acceptable for temperature applications between -65 degrees F (-54 degrees C) to 450 degrees F (232 degrees C). It has good resistance to ozone, weather, detergent, salt water, engine and transmission oil, non-petroleum brake fluid, hydraulic fluids that resist fire, vegetable and animal oils, and high molecular weight chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons. Silicone is vulnerable to mechanical wear and tear, water and steam over 250 degrees F (121 degrees C), aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene), chlorinated hydrocarbons (trichloroethylene), acids and bases, and hydrocarbon fuels.  O-rings commonly provide a pressure and fluid seal between cylindrically shaped, overlapping mating surfaces and are commonly seen in engines, faucets, flanges, valves, and various cylinders. They are circular in shape, with a round cross section and a hole in the center, similar to a doughnut. O-rings are available in a number of sizes, and can be ordered based on required nominal inside diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), and cross-sectional (CS) diameter.    This silicone O-ring has a shore durometer of 70A. Shore durometer is the hardness of a material, and its resistance to permanent indentation. A higher durometer value indicates greater resistance to indentation on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 indicating no indentation.    This silicone O-ring meets standards defined by Aerospace Standard AS568A, which is the Aerospace Size Standard for O-rings.

About Columbia Sportswear Founded in 1938, Columbia Sportswear Company has grown from a small family-owned hat distributor to one of the world's largest outerwear brands and the leading seller of ski-wear in the United States. Columbia's extensive product line includes a wide variety of outerwear, sportswear, rugged footwear and accessories. Columbia specializes in developing innovative products that are functional yet stylish and offer great value. Eighty-year-old matriarch Gert Boyle, Chairman of the Board, and her son, Tim Boyle, President and CEO, lead the company. Columbia's history starts with Gert's parents, Paul and Marie Lamfrom, when they fled Germany in 1937. They bought a small hat distributorship in Portland, Oregon, and named it Columbia Hat Company, after the river bordering the city. Soon frustrated by poor deliveries from suppliers, the Lamfroms decided to start manufacturing products themselves. In 1948, Gert married college sweetheart Neal Boyle, who joined the family business and later took the helm of the growing company. When Neal suddenly died of a heart attack in 1970, Gert enlisted help from Tim, then a college senior. After that, it wasn't long before business really started to take off. Columbia was one of the first companies to make jackets from waterproof/breathable fabric. They introduced the breakthrough technology called the Columbia Interchange System, in which a shell and liner combine for multiple wearing options. In the early 1980s, then 60-year-old Gert began her role as "Mother Boyle" in Columbia's successful and popular advertising campaign. The company went public in 1998 and moved into a new era as a world leader in the active outdoor apparel industry. Today, Columbia Sportswear employs more than 1,800 people around the world and distributes and sells products in more than 50 countries and to more than 12,000 retailers internationally.

Spur Gear, 20 Degree Pressure Angle, Polyoxymethylene, Inch, 20 Pitch, 1.500&#034; Pitch Diameter, 0.250&#034; Bore, 1.500&#034; OD, 30 Teeth /SEP/ Spur Gear, 20 Degree Pressure Angle, Polyoxymethylene, Inch, 20 Pitch, 1.500&#034; Pitch Diameter, 0.250&#034; Bore, 1.500&#034; OD, 30 Teeth. This polyoxymethylene spur gear with 20-degree pressure angle (PA) and a diametral pitch (DP) of 20 transmits torque between parallel shafts to provide rotational power to another part of a motorized system. It has a 20-degree pressure angle for lower contact ratio between gears, resulting in higher load capacity than smaller pressure angles, and a 20-diametral pitch for applications requiring a balance between transferring torque and controlling changes in speed and direction of rotation with precision. This spur gear, which can mesh only with spur gears that have the same pressure angle and diametral pitch, is made of polyoxymethylene for quiet operation, low friction and moisture absorption, and high resistance to heat and abrasion. This SmallParts spur gear is suitable for use in a variety of commercial and industrial applications, such as construction equipment, aeronautics, conveyors, and manufacturing equipment, among others.Spur gears, the most common gear type, have a circular or cylindrical shape with teeth bordering the outer perimeter and are used for transmitting rotational torque and motion between parallel rotating shafts. A spur gear's pressure angle (PA), diametral pitch (also called DP or pitch), and its material are important factors to consider when purchasing. Gears come in several types for use in different power transmission configurations and for different applications, including bevel and miter gears (for rotating shafts perpendicular to each other), change gears (to increase or decrease torque and speed), helical gears (for high rates of rotational speed), internal gears (where one gear is nested inside the other), rack and pinion gears (for turning rotational motion into linear motion), and worm gears (for perpendicular shafts in tight spaces and quiet operation). Gears are suitable for use in the agriculture, automotive, construction, mining, and packaging industries, and can be found in a variety of machines, including bicycles, automobiles, and elevators, among others.

Puccini: Messa di Gloria; Preludio Sinfonico; Crisantemi /SEP/ Puccini: Messa di Gloria; Preludio Sinfonico; Crisantemi. Roberto Alagna and Antonio Pappano are two-thirds of the EMI triumvirate (corresponding member, Angela Gheorghiu), which has done well by Puccini on previous discs. Although this one steps outside the operatic canon into the lesser margins of the composer's output, it's all done so eloquently you forget how undistinguished the material sometimes is. Pappano and the London Symphony Orchestra are clearly in the middle of a love affair and seem to understand each other's every move. Alagna sails through his three sections, making slightly heavy weather of the "Gratias  with worrying signs of a widening vibrato, but happy enough in the oddly amiable Agnus Dei" duet with Thomas Hampson. Ffor a good example of the current all-round health of the LSO after several years of conservative core-repertory craft under its chief conductor, Colin Davis, listen to how beautifully the strings phrase the enlarged string quartet movement Crisantemi, which, together with the Preludio sinfonico, makes a welcome filler.  --Michael White	Unlike Verdi's Messa solenne (reviewed on page 67 of the March 2001 issue), which actually is a 'Messa di Gloria' or Missa brevis, Puccini's youthful work is a full setting of the Ordinary of the Mass more than 45 minutes in duration. Where Verdi looks across the Alps and dons the clothing of the Austro-German tradition, Puccini takes a different approach. He flexes his contrapuntal muscles in celebration of earlier Italian polyphony, yet the work's harmonic language at times predicts his later role as a genuine modernist. In addition, some of Puccini's oblique chord progressions recall Beethoven's modal archaisms in the Credo of the Missa solemnis, while Puccini's 'Cum sancto spiritu' strikingly echoes Beethoven's fugue on 'in gloria Dei Patris. Amen'. Rich and robust, if not yet fully integrated in style, the work has an attractive vigour and already evinces impressive orchestral assurance. The piece merits a performance as good as this one. The London Symphony Chorus and Orchestra perform beautifully for Antonio Pappano, who achieves a naturally expressive ebb and flow without distorted exaggeration. The two starry soloists have less to do, with Thomas Hampson's contributions coming near the end. In the 'Gratias agimus', Roberto Alagna sounds clangorous and tight-throated in alt, though he settles down somewhat in the 'Et incarnatus'. Hampson is much more refined in the 'Benedictus' and they both blend effectively in the Agnus Dei (if not in a way that allows one to imagine them as Manrico and Luna in the conductor's forthcoming EMI recording of Il trovatore). Pappano is careful not to separate Puccini's mixed colours and the warm recorded sound helps him in this. The Preludio sinfonico and the touching Crisantemi form an appropriate frame for the Mass. Pappano understands that the larger chrysanthemums of Puccini's string orchestra version require more restraint than the delicate blooms of the string quartet original. A very satisfying disc.

Wake Up and Goodnight (Harper Growing Tree) /SEP/ Wake Up and Goodnight (Harper Growing Tree). In another recycling of Zolotow's past works (see review, above), this new version of a 1971 title that was illustrated by Leonard Weisgard takes a circular approach. Paparone follows the awakening of young animals (in children's clothes) to a day of sunshine and play. A flip of the book (so it reads from back to front) prepares them and readers for sleep; ``trees whisper/the birds are still'' in a comfortably contemporary setting, where a dinosaur mobile hangs from the ceiling. The morning colors are citrus bright and energetic, while the night scenes appear in hushed shades of indigo. A pleasing edition: The book's rotations mimic those of day and night in a way that toddlers will comprehend. (Picture book. 1-6)  -- Copyright 1998, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.
