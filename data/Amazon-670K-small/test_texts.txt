chapter imine ear is open and my heart prepared the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold say is my kingdom lost shakespeareit was a feature peculiar to the colonial wars of north america that the toils and dangers of the wilderness were to be encountered before the adverse hosts could meet a wide and apparently an impervious boundary of forests severed the possessions of the hostile provinces of france and england the hardy colonist and the trained european who fought at his side frequently expended months in struggling against the rapids of the streams or in effecting the rugged passes of the mountains in quest of an opportunity to exhibit their courage in a more martial conflict but emulating the patience and self-denial of the practiced native warriors they learned to overcome every difficulty and it would seem that in time there was no recess of the woods so dark nor any secret place so lovely that it might claim exemption from the inroads of those who had pledged their blood to satiate their vengeance or to uphold the cold and selfish policy of the distant monarchs of europe.perhaps no district throughout the wide extent of the intermediate frontiers can furnish a livelier picture of the cruelty and fierceness of the savage warfare of those periods than the country which lies between the headwaters of the hudson and the adjacent lakes.the facilities which nature had there offered to the march of the combatants were too obvious to be neglected the lengthened sheet of the champlain stretched from the frontiers of canada deep within the borders of the neighboring province of new york forming a natural passage across half the distance that the french were compelled to master in order to strike their enemies near its southern termination it received the contributions of another lake whose waters were so limpid as to have been exclusively selected by the jesuit missionaries to perform the typical purification of baptism and to obtain for it the title of lake du saint sacrement the less zealous english thought they conferred a sufficient honor on its unsullied fountains when they bestowed the name of their reigning prince the second of the house of hanover the two united to rob the untutored possessors of its wooded scenery of their native right to perpetuate its original appellation of horican *winding its way among countless islands and imbedded in mountains the holy lake extended a dozen leagues still further to the south with the high plain that there interposed itself to the further passage of the water commenced a portage of as many miles which conducted the adventurer to the banks of the hudson at a point where with the usual obstructions of the rapids or rifts as they were then termed in the language of the country the river became navigable to the tide.while in the pursuit of their daring plans of annoyance the restless enterprise of the french even attempted the distant and difficult gorges of the allegheny it may easily be imagined that their proverbial acuteness would not overlook the natural advantages of the district we have just described it became emphatically the bloody arena in which most of the battles for the mastery of the colonies were contested forts were erected at the different points that commanded the facilities of the route and were taken and retaken razed and rebuilt as victory alighted on the hostile banners while the husbandman shrank back from the dangerous passes within the safer boundaries of the more ancient settlements armies larger than those that had often disposed of the scepters of the mother countries were seen to bury themselves in these forests whence they rarely returned but in skeleton bands that were haggard with care or dejected by defeat though the arts of peace were unknown to this fatal region its forests were alive with men its shades and glens rang with the sounds of martial music and the echoes of its mountains threw back the laugh or repeated the wanton cry of many a gallant and reckless youth as he hurried by them in the noontide of his spirits to slumber in a long night of forgetfulness.it was in this scene of strife and bloodshed that the incidents we shall attempt to relate occurred during the third year of the war which england and france last waged for the possession of a country that neither was destined to retain.the imbecility of her military leaders abroad and the fatal want to energy in her councils at home had lowered the character of great britain from the proud elevation on which it had been placed by the talents and enterprise of her former warriors and statesmen no longer dreaded by her enemies her servants were fast losing the confidence of self-respect in this mortifying abasement the colonists though innocent of her imbecility and too humble to be the agents of her blunders were but the natural participators they had recently seen a chosen army from that country which reverencing as a mother they had blindly believed invincible an army led by a chief who had been selected from a crowd of trained warriors for his rare military endowments disgracefully routed by a handful of french and indians and only saved from annihilation by the coolness and spirit of a virginian boy whose riper fame has since diffused itself with the steady influence of moral truth to the uttermost confines of christendom a wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected disaster and more substantial evils were preceded by a thousand fanciful and imaginary dangers the alarmed colonists believed that the yells of the savages mingled with every fitful gust of wind that issued from the interminable forests of the west the terrific character of their merciless enemies increased immeasurably the natural horrors of warfare numberless recent massacres were still vivid in their recollections nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to have drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of midnight murder in which the natives of the forests were the principal and barbarous actors as the credulous and excited traveler related the hazardous chances of the wilderness the blood of the timid curdled with terror and mothers cast anxious glances even at those children which slumbered within the security of the largest towns in short the magnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of reason and to render those who should have remembered their manhood the slaves of the basest of passions even the most confident and the stoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was becoming doubtful and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers who thought they foresaw all the possessions of the english crown in america subdued by their christian foes or laid waste by the inroads of their relentless allies.when therefore intelligence was received at the fort which covered the southern termination of the portage between the hudson and the lakes that montcalm had been seen moving up the champlain with an army numerous as the leaves on the trees its truth was admitted with more of the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior should feel in finding an enemy within reach of his blow the news had been brought toward the decline of a day in midsummer by an indian runner who also bore an urgent request from munro the commander of a work on the shore of the holy lake for a speedy and powerful reinforcement it has already been mentioned that the distance between these two posts was less than five leagues the rude path which originally formed their line of communication had been widened for the passage of wagons so that the distance which had been traveled by the son of the forest in two hours might easily be effected by a detachment of troops with their necessary baggage between the rising and setting of a summer sun the loyal servants of the british crown had given to one of these forest fastnesses the name of william henry and to the other that of fort edward calling each after a favorite prince of the reigning family the veteran scotchman just named held the first with a regiment of regulars and a few provincials a force really by far too small to make head against the formidable power that montcalm was leading to the foot of his earthen mounds at the latter however lay general webb who commanded the armies of the king in the northern provinces with a body of more than five thousand men by uniting the several detachments of his command this officer might have arrayed nearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising frenchman who had ventured so far from his reinforcements with an army but little superior in numbers.but under the influence of their degraded fortunes both officers and men appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable antagonists within their works than to resist the progress of their march by emulating the successful example of the french at fort du quesne and striking a blow on their advance.after the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated a rumor was spread through the entrenched camp which stretched along the margin of the hudson forming a chain of outworks to the body of the fort itself that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to depart with the dawn for william henry the post at the northern extremity of the portage that which at first was only rumor soon became certainty as orders passed from the quarters of the commander in chief to the several corps he had selected for this service to prepare for their speedy departure all doubt as to the intention of webb now vanished and an hour or two of hurried footsteps and anxious faces succeeded the novice in the military art flew from point to point retarding his own preparations by the excess of his violent and somewhat distempered zeal while the more practiced veteran made his arrangements with a deliberation that scorned every

diamonds are forever james bond /SEP/ diamonds are forever james bond probably the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in england raymond chandler this text refers to the hardcover edition ian fleming 1908-1964 creator of the world 's best-known secret agent is the author of fourteen james bond books born in london in 1908 and educated at eton and sandhurst he became the reuters moscow correspondent in 1929 in the spring of 1939 fleming went back to moscow as a special correspondent for the london times in june of that same year he joined naval intelligence and served throughout world war ii finally earning the rank of commander rnvsr sp. much of the james bond material was drawn directly from fleming 's experiences as an intelligence officer later fleming became a consultant on foreign affairs for the london sunday times by which time he had become far better known as the creator of james bond with its two fighting claws held forward like a wrestler 's arms the big pandinus scorpion emerged with a dry rustle from the finger-sized hole under the rock there was a small patch of hard flat earth outside the hole and the scorpion stood in the centre of this on the tips of its four pairs of legs its nerves and muscles braced for a quick retreat and its senses questing for the minute vibrations which would decide its next move the moonlight glittering down through the great thorn bush threw sapphire highlights off the hard black polish of the six-inch body and glinted palely on the moist white sting which protruded from the last segment of the tail now curved over parallel with the scorpion 's flat back slowly the sting slid home into its sheath and the nerves in the poison sac at its base relaxed the scorpion had decided greed had won over fear twelve inches away at the bottom of a sharp slope of sand the small beetle was concerned only with trudging on towards better pastures than he had found under the thorn bush and the swift rush of the scorpion down the slope gave him no time to open his wings the beetle 's legs waved in protest as the sharp claw snapped round his body and then the sting lanced into him from over the scorpion 's head and immediately he was dead after it had killed the beetle the scorpion stood motionless for nearly five minutes during this time it identified the nature of its prey and again tested the ground and the air for hostile vibrations reassured its fighting claw withdrew from the half-severed beetle and its two small feeding pincers reached out and into the beetle 's flesh then for an hour and with extreme fastidiousness the scorpion ate its victim the great thorn bush under which the scorpion killed the beetle was quite a landmark in the wide expanse of rolling veld some forty miles south of kissidougou in the south-western corner of french guinea on all horizons there were hills and jungle but here over twenty square miles there was flat rocky ground which was almost desert and amongst the tropical scrub only this one thorn bush perhaps because there was water deep beneath its roots had grown to the height of a house and could be picked out from many miles away the bush grew more or less at the junction of three african states it was in french guinea but only about ten miles north of the northernmost tip of liberia and five miles east of the frontier of sierra leone across this frontier are the great diamond mines around sefadu these are the property of sierra international which is part of the powerful mining empire of afric international which in turn is a rich capital asset of the british commonwealth an hour earlier in its hole among the roots of the great thorn bush the scorpion had been alerted by two sets of vibrations first there had been the tiny scraping of the beetle 's movements and these belonged to the vibrations which the scorpion immediately recognised and diagnosed then there had been a series of incomprehensible thuds round the bush followed by a final heavy quake which had caved in part of the scorpion 's hole these were followed by a soft rhythmic trembling of the ground which was so regular that it soon became a background vibration of no urgency after a pause the tiny scraping of the beetle had continued and it was greed for the beetle that after a day of sheltering from its deadliest enemy the sun finally got the upper hand against the scorpion 's memory of the other noises and impelled it out of its lair into the filtering moonlight and now as it slowly sucked the morsels of beetle-flesh off its feeding pincers the signal for the scorpion 's own death sounded from far away on the eastern horizon audible to a human but made up of vibrations which were far outside the range of the scorpion 's sensory system and a few feet away a heavy blunt hand with bitten finger nails softly raised a jagged piece of rock there was no noise but the scorpion felt a tiny movement in the air above it at once its fighting claws were up and groping and its sting was erect in the rigid tail its near-sighted eyes staring up for a sight of the enemy the heavy stone came down 'black bastard the man watched as the broken insect whipped in its death agony the man yawned he got to his knees in the sandy depression against the trunk of the bush where he had been sitting for nearly two hours and his arms bent protectingly over his head scrambled out into the open the noise of the engine which the man had been waiting for and which had signed the scorpion 's death warrant was louder as the man stood and stared up the path of the moon he could just see a clumsy black shape coming fast towards him out of the east and for a moment the moonlight glinted on whirling rotor blades the man rubbed his hands down the sides of his dirty khaki shorts and moved quickly round the bush to where the rear wheel of a battered motor-cycle protruded from its hiding place below the pillion on either side there were leather toolboxes from one of these he extracted a small heavy package which he stowed inside his open shirt against the skin from the other he took four cheap electric torches and went off with them to where fifty yards from the big horns bush there was a clear patch of flat ground about the size of a tennis court at three corners of the landing ground he screwed the butt end of a torch into the ground and switched it on then the last torch alight in his hand he took up his position at the fourth corner and waited the helicopter was moving slowly towards him not more than a hundred feet from the ground the big rotor blades idling it looked like a huge badly constructed insect to the man on the ground it seemed as usual to be making too much noise the helicopter paused pitching slightly directly over his head an arm came out of the cockpit and a torch flashed at him it flashed dot-dash the morse for a the man on the ground flashed back a b and a c. he stuck the fourth torch into the ground and moved away shielding his eyes against the coming whirl of dust above him the pitch of the rotor blades flattened imperceptibly and the helicopter settled smoothly into the space between the four torches the clatter of the engine stopped with a final cough the tail rotor spun briefly in neutral and the main rotor blades completed a few awkward revolutions and then drooped to a halt in the echoing silence a cricket started to zing in the thorn bush and somewhere near at hand there was the anxious chirrup of a nightbird after a pause to let the dust settle the pilot banged open the door of the cockpit pushed out a small aluminium ladder and climbed stiffly to the ground he waited beside his machine while the other man walked round the four corners of the landing ground picking up and dowsing the torches the pilot was half an hour late at the rendezvous and he was bored at the prospect of listening to the other man 's inevitable complaint he despised all afrikaners this one in particular to a reichsdeutscher and to a luftwaffe pilot who had fought under galland in defence of the reich they were a bastard race sly stupid and ill-bred of course this brute had a tricky job but it was nothing to navigating a helicopter five hundred miles over the jungle in the middle of the night and then taking it back again as the other man came up the pilot half raised his hand in greeting 'everything all right i hope so but you 're late again i shall only just make it through the frontier by first light 'magneto trouble we all have our worries thank god there are only thirteen full moons a year well if you 've got the stuff let 's have it and we 'll tank her up and i 'll be off without speaking the man from the diamond mines reached into his shirt and handed over the neat heavy packet the pilot took it it was damp with the sweat from the smuggler 's ribs the pilot dropped it into a side pocket of his trim bush shirt he put his hand behind him and wiped his fingers on the seat of his shorts 'good he said he turned towards his machine 'just a moment said the diamond smuggler there was a sullen note in his voice the pilot turned back and faced him he thought it 's the voice of a servant who has screwed himself up to complain about his food 'ja what is it 'things are getting too hot at the mines i do n't like it at all there 's been a big intelligence man down from london you 've read about him this man sillitoe they say he 's been hired by the diamond corporation there 've been a lot of new regulations and all punishments have been doubled it 's frightened out some of my smaller men i had to be ruthless and well one of them somehow fell into the crusher that tightened things up a bit but i 've had to pay more an extra ten per cent and they 're still not satisfied one of these days those security people are going to get one of my middlemen and you know these black swine they ca n't stand a real beating he looked swiftly into the pilot 's eyes and then away again 'for the matter of that i doubt if anyone could stand the sjambok not even me 'so said the pilot he paused 'do you want me to pass this threat back to abc i 'm not threatening anyone said the other man hastily i just want them to know that it 's getting tough they must know it themselves they must know about this man sillitoe and look what the chairman said in our annual report he said that our mines were losing more than two million pounds a year through smug-gling and ide and that it was up to the government to stop it and what does that mean it means stop me 'and me said the pilot mildly 'so what do you want more money 'yes said the other man stubbornly i want a bigger cut twenty per cent more or i 'll have to quit he t this text refers to an out of print or unavailable
