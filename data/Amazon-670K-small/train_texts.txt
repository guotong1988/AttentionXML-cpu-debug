methodical bible study a new approach to hermeneutics /SEP/ methodical bible study a new approach to hermeneutics inductive study compares related bible texts in order to let the bible interpret itself rather than approaching scripture with predetermined notions of what it will say dr. trainas methodical bible study was not intended to be the last word in inductive bible study but since its first publication in 1952 it has become a foundational text in this field christian colleges and seminaries have made it required reading for beginning bible students while many churches have used it for their lay bible study groups dr. traina summarizes its success in this comment if the truths of the bible already resided in man there would be no need for the bible and this manual would be superfluous but the fact is the bible is an objective body of literature which exists because man needs to know certain truths which he himself can not know there are two main approaches open to the bible student one is deduction which begins with generalizations and moves for their support to the particulars by its very nature deduction tends to be subjective and prejudicial its opposite induction is objective and impartial for it demands that one first examine the particulars of the scriptures and that ones conclusions be based on those particulars such an approach is sound because being objective it corresponds to the objective nature of the scriptures this book fills the need for a simple practical textbook in hermeneutics it encourages the serious bible student to practice the best kind of hermeneutic which allows the word of god to speak for itself this text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title robert a. traina was thompson professor of biblical studies at asbury theological seminary wilmore ky he held the stb and stm degrees from biblical seminary in new york and the phd degree from drew uinversity this text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title

spin the edgar award and shamus award-winning fade away drop shot and deal breaker which won an anthony award and received an edgar award nomination.he lives in new jersey with his wife daughter and two sons.his e-mail address is bolitar aol.com.visit his website at www.harlancoben.com an hour before his world exploded like a ripe tomato under a stiletto heel myron bit into a fresh pastry that tasted suspiciously like a urinal cake.well mom prompted.myron battled his throat won a costly victory swallowed not bad.mom shook her head disappointed.what i 'm a lawyer mom said you 'd think i 'd have raised a better liar.you did the best you could myron said.she shrugged and waved a hand at the uh pastry it 's my first time baking bubbe it 's okay to tell me the truth.it 's like biting into a urinal cake myron said.a what in men 's public bathrooms in the urinals they put them there for the smell or something.and you eat them no is that why your father takes so long in there he 's having a little tastykake and here i thought his prostate was acting up.i 'm joking mom.she smiled through blue eyes tinged with a red that visine could never hope to get out the red you can only get through slow steady tears normally mom was heavily into histrionics slow steady tears were not her style so am i mr. smarty pants you think you 're the only one in this family with a sense of humor myron said nothing he looked down at the uh pastry fearing or perhaps hoping it might crawl away in the thirty-plus years his mother had lived in this house she had never baked not from a recipe not from scratch not even from one of those pillsbury morning croissant thingies that came in small mailing tubes she could barely boil water without strict instructions and pretty much never cooked though she could whip up a mean celeste frozen pizza in the microwave her agile fingers dancing across the numerical keypad in the vein of nureyev at lincoln center no in the bolitar household the kitchen was more a gathering place a family room lite if you will than anything related to even the basest of the culinary arts the round table held magazines and catalogs and congealing white boxes of chinese takeout the stovetop saw less action than a merchant-ivory production the oven was a prop strictly for show like a politician 's bible.something was definitely amiss.they were sitting in the living room with the dated pseudo-leather white modular couch and aqua-tinged rug whose shagginess reminded myron of a toilet-seat cover grown-up greg brady myron kept stealing glances out the picture window at the for sale sign in the front yard as though it were a spaceship that had just landed and something sinister was about to step out.where 's dad mom gave a weary wave toward the door he 's in the basement.in my room your old room yes you moved out remember he did at the tender age of thirty-four no less childcare experts would salivate and tsk-tsk over that one the prodigal son choosing to remain in his split-level cocoon long after the deemed appropriate deadline for the butterfly to break free but myron might argue the opposite he might bring up the fact that for generations and in most cultures offspring lived in the familial home until a ripe old age that adopting such a philosophy could indeed be a societal boom helping people stay rooted to something tangible in this era of the disintegrating nuclear family or if that rationale did n't float your boat myron could try another he had a million.but the truth of the matter was far simpler he liked hanging out in the burbs with mom and dad even if confessing such a sentiment was about as hip as an air supply eight track.so what 's going on he asked.your father does n't know you 're here yet she said he thinks you 're not coming for another hour.myron nodded puzzled what 's he doing in the basement he bought a computer your father plays with it down there.dad my point exactly the man ca n't change a lightbulb without a manual all of a sudden he 's bill gates always on the nest.the net myron corrected.the what it 's called the net mom.i thought it was nest the bird 's nest or something.no it 's net.are you sure i know there 's a bird in there somewhere.the web maybe myron tried like with a spider.she snapped her fingers that 's it anyway your father is on there all the time weaving the web or whatever he chats with people myron that 's what he tells me he chats with complete strangers like he used to do with the cb radio remember myron remembered circa 1976 jewish dads in the suburbs checking for smokeys on the way to the delicatessen mighty convoy of cadillac sevilles ten-four good buddy.and that 's not all she went on he 's typing his memoirs a man who ca n't scribble down a grocery list without consulting strunk and white suddenly thinks he 's an ex-president.they were selling the house myron still could not believe it his eyes wandered about the overly familiar surroundings his gaze getting snagged on the photographs running up the stairwell he saw his family mature via fashion the skirts and sideburns lengthening and shortening the quasi-hippie fringes and suede and tie-dyes the leisure suits and bell-bottoms the frilly tuxedos that would be too tacky for a vegas casino the years flying by frame by frame like one of those depressing life insurance commercials he spotted the poses from his basketball days a sixth-grade suburban-league foul shot an eighth-grade drive to the hoop a high school slam dunk the row ending with sports illustrated cover shots two from his days at duke and one with his leg in a cast and a large-fonted is he finished emblazoned across his knee-cast image the answer in the mind 's eye being an equally large-fonted yes .so what 's wrong he asked.i did n't say anything was wrong.myron shook his head disappointed and you a lawyer.setting a bad example it 's no wonder i never ran for higher office.she folded her hands on her lap we need to chat.myron did n't like the tone.but not here she added let 's take a walk around the block.myron nodded and they rose before they reached the door his cell phone rang myron snatched it up with a speed that would have made wyatt earp step back he put the phone to his ear and cleared his throat.mb sportsreps he said silky-smooth professional-like this is myron bolitar speaking.nice phone voice esperanza said you sound like billy dee ordering two colt 45s.esperanza diaz was his longtime assistant and now sports-agent partner at mb sportsreps m for myron the b for bolitar for those keeping score .i was hoping you were lamar he said.he has n't called yet nope.he could almost see esperanza frown we 're in deep doo-doo here she said.we 're not in deep doo-doo we 're just sucking a little wind that 's all.sucking a little wind esperanza repeated like pavarotti running the boston marathon.good one myron said.thanks.lamar richardson was a power-hitting golden glove shortstop who 'd just become a free agent free agent being a phrase agents whisper in the same way a mufti might whisper praise allah lamar was shopping for new representation and had whittled his final list down to three agencies two supersized conglomerates with enough office space to house a price club and the aforementioned pimple-on-the-buttocks but oh-so-personal mb sportsreps go pimple-butt myron watched his mother standing by the door he switched ears and said anything else you 'll never guess who called esperanza said.elle and claudia demanding another menage a trois oooo close.she would never just tell him with his friends everything was a tv game show how about a hint he said.one of your ex-lovers.he felt a jolt jessica.esperanza made a buzzing noise sorry wrong bitch.myron was puzzled he 'd only had two long-term relationships in his life jessica on and off for the past thirteen years now very off and before that well you 'd have to go back to emily downing esperanza made a ding-ding noise.a sudden image pierced his heart like a straight-blade he saw emily sitting on that threadbare couch in the frat basement smiling that smile at him her legs bent and tucked under her wearing his high school varsity jacket that was several sizes too big her gesturing hands slipping down and disappearing into the sleeves.his mouth went dry what did she want do n't know but she said that she simply had to talk to you she 's very breathy you know like everything she says is a double entendre.with emily everything was.she good in the sack esperanza asked.being an overly attractive bisexual esperanza viewed everyone as a potential sex partner myron wondered what that must be like to have and thus weigh so many options and then he decided to leave that road untraveled wise man.what did emily say exactly myron said.nothing specific she j the comedic adventures of sports agent myron bolitar take a dark turn in the seventh book in his series when bolitar and friends face a case of a

conservative jewish congregation and lives in chevy chase md preface the story behind the storyin august 1945 ernie mayerfeld a nineteen-year-old gi stationed in berlin received a letter from his father in new york asking him to undertake a mission for a family friend until 1938 the elder mayerfeld had been a prosperous leather distributor in frankfurt even as the nazi persecution mounted in germany it had seemed inconceivable to herr mayerfeld that the familys comfortable life would be disrupted permanently after all the familys roots in germany and austria went back hundreds of years the residence of one ancestor the baron eskeles whose wife was a patroness of mozart today serves as the home of viennas jewish museum and after the nazis took power in 1933 he still could not foresee the worst had he not received a medal for his service at the front in world war i accompanied by a letter of thanks signed by der fhrer himself not even the 1938 kristallnacht pogrom in which herr mayerfeld narrowly escaped arrest had convinced him to emigrate only in the ensuing months when his suppliers would no longer sell him the merchandise needed for his business was he finally persuaded to flee and so virtually at the last possible moment and aided by a large dose of good luck the mayerfelds escaped and eventually made their way to new york where fourteen-year-old ernst turned himself into ernie an american teenager five years later after fighting in the battle of the bulge he returned to the country of his birth as one of the occupying u.s. troops his fathers request was one of many that ernie had received asking him to look for surviving relatives of german jewish migrs in the united states frequently the searches were unavailing but in this case herr mayerfelds friend was certain that his sister johanna frank had survived the war as a nurse in the berlin jewish hospital he sent a package of foodstuffs to be delivered to her and so one day ernie made his way through the rubble and devastation of occupied berlin to 2 iranischestrasse in the wedding district there he found a spacious compound of seven buildings set in a large garden carved in stone over the main entrance on iranischestrasse in the pediment of the administration building was the name krankenhaus der jdischen gemeinde or hospital of the jewish community johanna frank was indeed there attending to her nursing duties the buildings were all still standing ernie remembered although some of them had taken hits in the bombing inside though it was unbelievable doctors in white coats and nurses in clean starched uniforms bustled through spotless corridors and rooms attending to their patients it was as if the twelve years of nazi horror had never happened astounded by what he found ernie asked schwester johanna and her coworkers how it was possible that this hospital full of jews had made it through the nazi period all agreed that it was a miracle but no one had a coherent explanation to offer more than half a century passed filled with marriage family and a successful career as a cia officer and later as a lawyer in the cias office of general counsel from time to time ernie thought about his strange experience at the berlin jewish hospital and wondered about the story that lay behind it but he had no time to make inquiries at a dinner party in the late 1970s or early 1980s about the same time that ernie and i became legal colleagues at the cia and grew to be close friends i met klaus zwilsky a charming and ebullient man then in his fifties who spoke with a slight german accent over the years we continued to see each other one night over dinner the talk turned to how it must feel to live under the constant threat of bombing i dont remember how the topic arose probably we were talking about beirut or one of the worlds other perennial hot spots klaus listened for a while and then volunteered a comment describing his own emotions as a child in berlin in 1944 and 1945 cowering fearfully in the cellar while allied bombers attacked the city but klaus someone said i dont understand youre jewish your parents were both 100 percent jewish how could you have been living in berlin during the last years of the war my father worked at the jewish hospital klaus explained and we all lived there he said a few more words about his experience of the allied air raids and the conversation moved on to other things in this way i too learned that a jewish hospital in berlin had remained open throughout the entire nazi era and that jewish doctors nurses administrators and patients had survived there the fact astonished me i thought i knew a goood deal about the nazi persecution of german jews i had read widely on the subject of the holocaust i was aware that a handful of jews haddddd survived in germany some in hiding some protected by marriage to non-jews but i also knew or thought i knew that the nazis had ruthlessly extirpated every trace of jewish life in germany they had destroyed the synagogues desecrated the cemeteries dissolved the jewish organizations prohibited jewish worship driven two-thirds of germanys jews into exile and then deported all but a handful of those who remained the lucky ones to the ghetto established in theresienstadt in what had once been czechoslovakia and the rest to the death camps of eastern europe how then was it possible that a jewish hospital operating openly under the name krankenhaus der jdischen gemeinde had continued to exist in berlin throughout the war how was it that klaus and his parents full jews with no apparent form of protection could have survived the war living in that hospital the question kept recurring through the next two decades of a life that like ernies was too busy to permit further investigation klaus who had been only a child during the war years was reticent about his experiences and volunteered no further explanation i could find nothing written on the subject in english-language sources years went by years during which from time to time i would say to myself someday i need to find out about the jewish hospital and then move on to whatever preoccupation was more pressing finally the day came when circumstances made it possible for me to begin serious research on the berlin jewish hospital during the wartime years my immediate thought was to ask ernie mayerfeld if he would be interested in joining me did you know that there was a jewish hospital in berlin that operated all the way through world war ii i asked his response took me by surprise everyone else to whom i mentioned this fact reacted with astonishment ernie looked sheepish not only do i know that he said haltingly i was there he proceeded to tell me the story of his 1945 visit we agreed that we would set out together to find out how and why this hospital alone among all of germanys jewish institutions had survived when everything else associated with german jewry was being destroyed our initial objective was to satisfy our own curiosity as we found out more however we agreed that we should write something that would bring this astonishing story to the publics attention our determination to do so was strengthened when we discovered that the only internet reference we could find was on a scurrilous neo-nazi holocaust-denial web site where the fact that the berlin jewish hospital operated throughout the war was adduced as proof that the nazi atrocities had never occurred our research quickly revealed that the essential facts relating to the berlin jewish hospital were not unknown in the small circle of scholars who have devoted themselves to the study of the german jewish experience during the nazi era indeed many facts pertaining to the hospitals survival from 1938 through 1945 have been recorded in two german-language publications in a small monograph devoted to the 193845 period and in portions of a larger history of the hospital both were the products of extensive archival research and of interviews with war survivors the findings of the monograph were summarized in english in an article in a scholarly journal the leo baeck institute year book passing references to the hospital also could be found in other scholarly books on german jewry during the nazi era thus we found that the task of preserving the record for the scholarly community had largely been completed nor had the existence of the hospital in the war period completely escaped the attention even of authors who wrote for a more popular audience fleeting references to it gave evidence that they knew it was there for example in a fascinating book the last jews in berlin leonard gross tells the stories of several jews who survived the final years of the nazi period in hiding in berlin a passing reference makes clear that he knew that the hospital was in operation throughout this period but nothing more is said about the institution and the large number of jews who were living there openly none of the scholarly or passing accounts we felt satisfactorily addressed two important questions again and again we asked ourselves how could this have happened so too has almost everyone who has encountered the simple fact of the hospitals survival another question that the barest outline of the facts about the hospital urgently raises is what was it like to live and work in such circumstances and so we set out to do two things first we wanted to supplement the existing historical record as much as possible knowing that t

edged in for the kill close enough to kiss he held the death blow upon his tongue and unleashed it along with an inadvertent wad of spit the oh shits of the crowd came through clenched teeth skinny man did not wait for an apology he threw up a fist and connected quickly fat man replied and the entire crowd exploded the fight ensued outside of the club rampage it was one of the more popular hip-hop nightclubs in lower manhattan at seeing the progressing affray two very big well-dressed bouncers parted their way through and quickly put an end to it they pulled the two young men apart who in truth did not want to be fighting but were merely caught up in the adrenaline of the movement there were suvs and all manner of expensive cars parked outside from the lexus to the benz the bouncers dressed in black suits stood at the door there was a railing that kept the people lined against the wall the dense procession extended the stretch of the block and around the corner the line was a dichotomy of gender and style the women were dressed from head to toe in the most revealing tight-fitting things they could have squeezed their frames into while the men wore loose-fitting denim complemented by work boots or sneakers with a t-shirt or some form of sports jersey the pounding music from inside was well heard the beat beckoned the people in with baited anticipation.a young man at the front made his way past the bouncers and was handed a flyer as he proceeded upon the flyer it read hip-hop speak out for justice speak out for truth free all political prisoners fight against the war on terrorism and on the cover it showed a man with profound eyes dreadlocks and handcuffs there was more to be read but the young man paid it no mind and quickly folded it into his pocket his mind was already well engaged by the beautiful young girl walking in front of him keen to the manufactured faded area about her rear they arrived at the security check where they were frisked while the muscled guard grabbed at all parts of his body he was far more concerned with the aggressive gropes that the stout female security guard addressed to the girl when they were finished the girl walked away and the young man approached the female guard yo ma tell me how can i get yo job she curled the corner of her lips in sarcasm and prodded him along he tried to catch up to the girl he however entered the main floor to complete confusion the club was packed the crowd thick and the music loud he looked about without discretion but it was all for naught he had lost her in the shuffle of flesh and the psychedelic pattern of lights but within a minute he did n't seem to mind as another beautiful girl squeezed her way across his brow and his thoughts followed the sway of hips the crowd was dense being anywhere from fifteen hundred to two thousand people while bopping their heads to the beat and dancing as much as the space would allow they focused their attentions toward the stage at the dj he was well known and by the smoothness in his scratches well deserving of his accolades he was ra the hottest dj in the city above him an all-encompassing banner for bin laden hung bin laden was the most popular hip-hop act at the time he was the premier artist in the crown records roster as such the name of the ubiquitous music juggernaut was imprinted alongside his and just below bin laden 's banner was another for bet freestyle championship again the symbol for crown records was imprinted as crown was the sponsor of both events the music began to fade as a man and a woman entered the stage she was cute medium-tanned stockily built well-fitted in her mix of bohemian and hip-hop he was lean tall dark handsome attired in a mix of thug and preppy they were free and

hard work but they both did it and they are both here tonight to determine who is the best of the best now do y'all know who we are talking about free asked.the crowd began to shout out flawless and

dressed with his white shell-top sneakers his light blue jeans his black loose-fitting t-shirt and his hair a well-cut blowout in his timberland boots hannibal appeared more rugged his clothes were darker and baggier his demeanor sterner and his head was bald the crowd reacted to the difference in their styles the women screamed and swooned for flawless while the men barked and howled for hannibal through the noise they remained silent free broke through the barking now gentlemen let 's get the rules straight basically there are no rules this is n't like our televised show so there are

twin tracks the unexpected origins of the modern world /SEP/ twin tracks the unexpected origins of the modern world james burke author and public television star returns with another quirky look at the way history works in twin tracks burke connects trigger events with unexpected outcomes for instance the invention of the lens-grinding lathe leads to hairdressing and the debut of mozart 's the marriage of figaro connects to development of the stealth fighter jet these events are tied together via two tracks one written along the book 's left-hand pages and one along the right the narratives meet up in the end giving readers a clear idea that the lines of history can be quite subjective some of the examples even run backward as when burke explains the connections between smallpox and the big bang while burke is justifiably famous for linking historical events the paths he takes especially those involving lots of unfamiliar names can be tricky to follow in 1710 the art collection was sold to philip regent of france in a deal brokered by benedetto luti the best painter in rome at the time that year luti took on an assistant by 1714 william kent was painting originals his patron in all this was the trillionaire earl of burlington the best way to read twin tracks as with any of burke 's lovely books is one chapter at a time taking thinking breaks in between so as not to become overwhelmed by detail the networks he describes form a more accurate if more challenging picture of history 's motion than any linear sequence therese littleton this text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title burke is back with another volume of the surprising and frequently serendipitous connections among the seemingly unconnected people events and discoveries that have shaped our modern world his work which by this point comprises a genre in itself including such titles as the knowledge web and the pinball effect meanders through the history of science medicine and technology playing an intellectual history version of six degrees of kevin bacon his motto everything is connected as in earlier books burke tweaks the form a bit this time offering 25 pairs of parallel narratives each pair starts with one trigger event then they diverge and reconverge at the end hence the book 's title want to know how the boston tea party led to the development of contact lenses or the marriage of figaro to the f-117a stealth fighter burke can tell you following two simultaneous threads that careen off in wildly different directions from the trigger event then create the conditions for the end result one could complain that his connections are sometimes tenuous at best more synchronicity than cause-and-effect but that would miss the point-the real fun is in burke 's dry wit and his sheer exuberance as he takes us through centuries of history in mere pages only to pick a new starting point and do it all over again b illus.copyright 2003 reed business information inc. this text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title burke 's book requires physical effort from the reader and this inventive impresario of science history warns that peeking ahead spoils the fun but later about that first the substance here is burke 's forte showing the connections that come together in a particular technology one reason for burke 's popularity is his irreverent snarkiness for the characters in these two-dozen stories are invariably nerds and freaks plus everybody seems to be in a tizzy about some device poem or courtesan while en route in burke 's tales from for example the opening night of the marriage of figaro to the stealth fighter to structure his trips such as the one from mozart to the f-117 burke seizes on two individuals connected to an event or place and divides their stories into two distinct narratives you 're to read track one on the left-hand pages then flip back for track two on the right-hand ones the author then springs his surprise the contraption that unites the two tracks burke is as quirky and entertaining as ever gilbert taylorcopyright american library association all rights reserved

9:47 p.m. on september 4 1804 under the watchful eye of the uss constitution the fireship uss intrepid packed with gunpowder and shells sneaked into tripoli harbor and blew itself up this incursion was in response to four years of attacks by tripoli pirates on american mediterranean shipping with the loss of one american ship and her three-hundred-person crew at the time of the attack languishing in tripoli jails and soon after released track one the man controlling events that night and in overall command of the constitution three schooners and eight other ships a total of 156 guns and 1,060 sailors was the bad-tempered commodore edward preble a veteran of the war of independence preble had been ordered to make his base at valetta on the island of malta but for various reasons preferred syracuse on the island of sicily malta was british at the time which might have had something to do with preble 's sicily decision at one point preble and his fellow officers dined with a visiting and rather inquisitive brit who unknown to preble was working as spy and dispatch-writer for the governor of malta alexander ball ball a naval officer and friend of nelson was an old hand at running ships and islands but less good at prose the scribbler in question had left england for malta for reasons of health and was by this time trying and failing to kick his opium habit while continuing to pen the stuff that would make him one of the most famous of all romantic poets samuel taylor coleridge in 1805 having failed to give up drugs and yearning for the drizzle coleridge left malta for london via rome where he heard the news that napoleon had him marked for assassination because of some earlier article he 'd written in the morning post the purveyor of this tidbit was the prussian representative to the vatican wilhelm von humboldt by this point wilhelm was a well-known esthete with some major literary criticism work behind him he would also go on to become a lead player in comparative linguistics and fail to complete a great work on some obscure javanese dialect prussian liberals like wilhelm helped bring about teacher-training reforms and the establishment of a university in berlin they also talked a lot cautiously about civil rights and how the powers of the state should be limited most of this spirited chatter went on at the berlin elite-meet salon where wilhelm dropped in from time to time run by the extraordinary rahel varnhagen von ense ne levin upwardly mobile daughter of a rich businessman to her contemporaries von ense was the most cultured woman in europe only mme de stal might have disagreed for a few years at the beginning of the century von ense organized gatherings that attracted princes commoners composers mendelssohn thinkers goethe poets heine jews and christians germans and foreigners you were welcome if you had a point of view a witty tongue or intellectually demanding matters to reveal as was the case with the reverend friedrich schleiermacher a salon regular and local preacher schleiermacher was to religion what the romantics were to the arts a reaction to the rational excesses of the enlightenment he held that belief was n't something to be objectively analyzed and dissected au contraire it was a mystical utterly subjective experience that left the believer with a feeling of absolute dependence it was only though this immersion in the sensation of belief that one came to god if you read only what was in quotation marks you 've read key words from the romantic movement manifesto in 1824 one of schleiermacher 's minor pieces on the gospel of st. luke was translated into english and so impressed the ecclesiastical powers-that-were that it achieved for the translator the prestige job of bishop of st. david 's in wales the high-flyer in question rejoiced in the anagram-fodder name of connop thirlwall began as a priest then became a lawyer then a classics don at cambridge where he made waves by saying that low-church protestants should be let into the church of england was fired became vicar of a church in bucolic nowhere then finished his multivolume history of greece and was elevated to the episcopacy thirlwall 's history was published by the then-famous dionysius lardner regarded as a major science popularizer or charlatan depending on who was regarding lardner forecast the link to india through the red sea long before the suez canal and lobbied for transatlantic steamships when people thought the idea of dropping sail was crazy it was during his early years as professor of natural philosophy and astronomy at london university that he began his great cabinet cyclopedia 133 volumes edited over twenty years the encarta of its day contributors were legendary including charles macintosh sir walter scott sismondi and herschel lardner also included a young writer trying to make money to support her child after her husband had been drowned in a sailing accident in italy in 1822 mary shelley author of frankenstein pal of byron daughter of feminist mary wollstonecraft fancied by french novelist-antiquarian prosper mrime grieving and beautiful widow of tragic poet percy bysshe shelley was everything a romantic was supposed to be in her later years she scraped a living from writings which included the piece for lardner on italian literature mary dedicated her last effort rambles in germany and italy 1844 to a longtime friend one of those poets who sink almost without trace ever heard of samuel rogers 's the pleasures of memory 1792 what rogers lacked in talent he made up for in generosity having inherited a fortune at a young age he proceeded via a large and expensively decorated london house to entertain anybody who wrote better poetry than he did this had to be a great many and included byron shelley wordsworth and sheridan all his life rogers continued to churn out poetry so bad that only he would publish it nonetheless he must have impressed a senior bureaucrat because when wordsworth died in 1850 rogers was offered the poet laureateship he declined the honor so they gave it to somebody named tennyson by this time pulling out of a struggle with booze and with some very respectable work behind him tennyson was the victorian poet par excellence all gloom and saccharine apart from one foot wrong written during the crimean war the charge of the light brigade hinted at such incompetence in the army that it outraged every right-thinking harrumph tennyson could do no wrong especially after queen victoria gave him the ultimate nod throughout his writing career tennyson returned again and again to his love of the medieval and in particular king arthur with highly polished stuff like morte d'arthur and the lady of shalott tennyson 's knights-of-old flimflam fired the callow imaginations of every undergraduate particularly those of william morris and his pals burne-jones and rossetti who took medievalry further over the top inventing the pre-raphaelite school of painting and cutesy pseudo-fourteenth-century arts and crafts wooden furniture and flowered wallpaper that gave you eyestrain all of which made them a fortune when it hit late industrial revolution consumers beginning to yearn for the imagined simplicity and tranquillity of a recently bygone age of prefactory country pleasures this attempt to return to the purer life of a time before the downtrodden proletariat existed sprang from morris 's dyed-in-the-wool socialism this he shared with george bernard shaw a down-at-heel frayed-cuff would-be journalist who joined morris 's socialist league in 1888 in 1893 shaw caused a furor with his first censored play about a prostitute pungent on-stage social comment followed in the shape of boffo successes like the devil 's disciple major barbara pygmalion in a later existence my fair lady and arms and the man by the time he died at ninety shaw was considered the world 's greatest living dramatist shaw socked it to all forms of what he considered humbug back in 1875 he wiped the floor with the visiting and renowned american evangelist dwight moody after attending one of moody 's music-and-prayer revivalist meetings moody who 'd started life as a boot salesman set the mold for revivalists thereafter rugged physique dark suit homespun philosophy plain ungrammatical language and the message that god loved you no matter what this approach went over very big with a medical student wilfred grenfell who went on to became a medical missionary to deep-sea sailors in 1892 he visited labrador and was so shocked by the poverty that he stayed longer and set up the labrador mission when he quit forty years later the mission consisted among other things of six hospitals seven nursing stations four schools a lumber-mill cooperative clothing distributors and four hospital ships in 1912 one of the temporary hospital-ship staff was a young man who had previously worked in the labrador fur trade he noticed that on days when the temperature was fifty below whenever the local natives pulled fish out of the water the catch instantly froze and months later when they thawed the fish out he noticed that some of them showed signs of life he tried the same trick on meat and veggies all of which retained their taste and consistency if they were quick-frozen while still fresh could it be made to work on an industrial scale back in the states by 1925 the young man was selling instantly frozen haddock fillets after which it was time for clarence birdseye to chill out and enjoy well-deserved fame and fortune end track one track two on board the uss constitution that night was lieutenant isaac chauncey who did so well during the tripoli war he ended up in charge of all naval forces on lakes ontario and erie where from 1813 he ran the first proper arms race in american history launching ships as fast as he could build them so as to clobber the brits who were on the canadian lakeshore launching ships as fast as they could build them before a full trial of strength could happen the war of 1812 ended chauncey 's boss was william jones who was then invited to become acting treasury secretary a year later 1814 the new economics czar resigned because his personal finances were in total chaos and he was up to his ears in debt so naturally enough when a decision was made to set up the second bank of the united states jones was the first choice to be its president things at the new bank went rapidly down the drain and included allegations of fraud on the part of jones first off the bank had expanded with dangerous rapidity and then gave customers such easy terms that everybody and his dog borrowed money and speculation became rife a month later when things started going wrong the bank recalled every loan property values dropped fivefold in some places and all over the nation thousands of individuals and small businesses went bankrupt one such loser was would-be bird painter j. j. audubon whose mississippi steamboat enterprise sank like a stone taking with it the entire savings of a newly immigrant newly wed couple named mr. and mrs. george keats back in england george 's brother poet john keats who 'd lent them some of the money went ballistic vowing to clobber audubon at first opportunity keats was the archetype of all romantic poets produced for only five intense years was pale and wan wrote about unrequited love and suicide and lovers chopped-off heads and caught the tuberculosis that killed him when still young quite apart from american money worries keats was always desperately short of cash so when magazine proprietor and publisher john taylor not only offered to print keats 's next epic offering endymion but also to come up with a healthy advance keats was as happy as a pig in manure taylor himself had to this point pursued an innocuous existence as a journalist publisher and writer on economic matters then in 1859 out of nowhere came his the great pyramid why was it built taylor was convinced the giza pyramid was n't egyptian at all but had been designed by an israelite maybe even noah himself acting under divine orders furthermore taylor opined the numbers relating to the pyramid 's complex dimensions hid a secret encoded message of universal importance from you-know-who this claptrap proved to be irresistible to charles piazzi smyth who was otherwise totally sane smyth was an astronomer royal society fellow and pal of serious stargazers like herschel nonetheless bitten by the pyramid bug at the height of his career he went off to giza measured every inch of the pyramid and in 1865 announced that the secret code explained everything in the old testament and foretold the second coming as a result of which the royal society booted him out but others took up the mystery was it a coincidence they asked that the pyramid inch was exactly the same as the imperial british inch this fatuous but strangely convincing load of hocus-pocus was given the coup de grce in 1880 by the down-and-dirty in-the-trenches work of archeologist hardhead flinders petrie whose dad had been a pyramidology convert petrie 's opinion on the matter was expressed in a paper written after exhaustive measure-and-dig efforts and called for archaeology to be more brush-and-scrape routine and less now-it-can-be-revealed gobbledygook his opinion of pyramidology can be summed up in one word garbage petrie set the tone for all later excavation as he went through sites in egypt and palestine like a hot knife through butter cut a trench look at the layers reveal the historical sequence he was able to do this in palestine thanks to the energetic palestine exploration fund money-raising capabilities of a great victorian amateur george grove grove began as an engineer working for the likes of shipbuilder robert napier and bridge builder robert stephenson then graduated to secretary of the society of arts music criticism and analysis friendship with the musical greats first director of the royal college of music and finally editor of the dictionary of music that now bears his name and saves all of us long research hours in the library in 1915 grove 's granddaughter stella proposed to peter eckersley and they were married two years later peter joined the royal flying corps as a wireless equipment officer in 1922 he was working for the radio equipment company founded by marconi to be given the first license for regular radio broadcasts which eckersley organized and took part in as actor announcer stage manager and engineer for half an hour every tuesday his team filled the airwaves for those very few able to hear them a year later the monopolistic never-consult-the-listener british broadcasting corporation was founded and eckersley became chief engineer his sidekick assistant engineer was noel ashbridge who later rose to a position in which he made the crucial decision about which system ought to be chosen for the bbc 's first tv broadcasts he chose the twenty-five-frames-per-second major-user-of-bandwidth 405-line-scan approach pioneered by an extraordinary russian immigrant named isaac schoenberg the result in london on november 2 1936 was the world 's first high-definition tv broadcast plaudits all round and eventually in the case of schoenberg and ashbridge ennoblement as sirs not so eckersley who was involved in a divorce and a whiff of scandal unacceptable to auntie beeb eckersley actually resigned these were the days when standards were high and radio announcers wore evening dress schoenberg had earlier set up the first radio stations in russia before leaving in 1914 for pastures western and more democratic apart from schoenberg 's success with tv he made another right move in 1929 when he hired a young engineer alan blumlein to develop a system which would save schoenberg and the beeb from having to pay through the nose for american sound-recording equipment royalties blumlein produced the required system and then in 1931 filed the patent for a technique that would generate the kind of sound to be enjoyed when the listener was using more than one ear in 1934 blumlein recorded beecham conducting mozart with a recording stylus vibrating in two directions in response to two incoming signals one vertical and the other in the same groove lateral we call what blumlein made possible stereo stereo first hit the general public in 1940 with walt disney 's fantasia recorded in stereo by the philadelphia orchestra and conducted by leopold stokowski who believed hollywood could bring good music to the masses initially he was wrong it would take until 1960 for the mix of mickey mouse and the music of bach tchaikovsky dukas stravinsky beethoven ponchielli mussorgsky and schubert to become a cult hit in the end stokowski 's innovative approach free breathing for the wind and free bowing for the strings which produced the rich stokowski sound and his penchant toward modern composers like berg schoenberg and such made the philadelphia old fogies see red and stokowski left for a flamboyant superstar life that included marriage to a vanderbilt one of his pals was perhaps unexpected for someone so extravagant irving langmuir was a self-effacing chemist nobel 1932 whose research ran the gamut from ice crystals in clouds and floating seaweed orientation to smoke screens and his main obsession molecular and atomic structures this included some original thinking about valence and bonding the way in which atoms could share electrons langmuir 's results encouraged chemists to approach the whole matter of how molecules happened in ways that turned out to have some interesting potential at least it did for thomas midgley working for a lab in dayton ohio and asked by his boss to solve the problem of knock incomplete combustion in the cylinder and no good for cars or drivers taking langmuir 's how-molecules-come-together approach to the elements midgley went through every single one of them looking for molecular arrangement that might do what was needed six years of minutiae later in 1921 he found it tetraethyl lead the additive that gave gasoline the name leaded encouraged by this discovery midgley 's boss then asked for a nontoxic nonflammable refrigerant those available at the time tended to leak and kill owners as they slept when midgley had it this time it took him only three days at the american chemical society meeting in 1930 he inhaled a lungful to show it was nontoxic and blew out a candle when he exhaled to show it was nonflammable the new wonder product became known as freon ironic that decades later midgley 's wonder chemicals should turn out to be bad for the individual lead poisoning and bad for the planet ozone hole end track two and finally thus it was that when clarence birdseye 's early fresh-frozen fillets were coming off his superchilled production line midgley 's freon-filled refrigerators were there to store them in fish sticks were here to stay copyright 2003 by london writers this text refers to an out of print or

his eyes to slits raised his cheekbones to temple level wrinkled his forehead and lifted his crew cut and in spite of the exaggerated width of the smile his lips never parted probably because of his

unsettling america an anthology of contemporary multicultural poetry /SEP/ unsettling america an anthology of contemporary multicultural poetry aptly titled this substantial anthology provides exposure to poets emerging and established-louis simpson rita dove luis rodriguez-who write directly from the immigrant ethnic and/or religious experience the collection gives evidence of inequality and discrimination and offers eyewitness accounts of the gross inconsistencies and bigotry of america the poems tap into visceral energies either born of or becoming a vitalizing anger they bristle with a recognition of failed expectations thoughtful and attentive the mother/daughter editorial team of the gillans divides the book into sections concerned with uprooting performing naming negotiating and finally and hopefully re-envisioning the most moving poems concern a loss of home and custom and the compromises struck in order to make life tolerable in a quietly and not so quietly intolerant society also distressing is work describing the intense desire of some poets to assimilate-efforts later remembered as humiliating this collection is a must for anyone seeking an inclusive unwincing catalogue of the american experience copyright 1994 reed business information inc ya featuring well-and lesser-known american poets from a variety of cultural backgrounds this volume presents fresh poems that tell the american stories of writers such as lawrence ferlinghetti gary soto louise erdrich ethelbert miller and lucille clifton selections are grouped by broad themes uprooting performing naming negotiating and re-envisioning the editors deliberately selected works that did not create a pluralistic play of voices or make a simplistic call for diversity but that directly address the instability of american identity and confront the prevalence of cultural conflict and exchange within the united states it is this focus and the conscious effort to avoid producing yet another supermarket survey of multicultural literature that make the book such a find brief biographical information is included gretchen portwood w.t woodson high school fairfax

the poets here including wong joy harjo jimmy santiago baca lucille clifton and mary tallmountain in five sections-uprooting performing naming negotiating and re-envisioning-the poets speak of their experiences in america a place/ where your skin/is your passport as yusef komunyakaa observes the poets here speak from the heart not only of the injustices they have suffered but also of their visions of a new land where all colors blend into one says judith ortiz cofer we will build our cities of light not all these poems are finely crafted but all express voices too long silent for all collections.doris lynch monroe cty p.l. bloomington ind.copyright 1994 reed business information inc imagine if you will a city bus in say uptown in chicago or any place else where a dozen american cultures collide this anthology is like that singaporean feminist poet shirley geok-lin lim is sitting next to creek indian joy harjo hawaiian garrett hongo is chatting with street-sounding david hernandez enid dame is talking about her radical jewish family to african american rita dove what could be cacophony turns instead into a kind of dissonant love song under the visionary editing of the

on the current bethesda guidelines for reporting and managing cervical cytology new information and guidelines on sexually transmitted diseases a unique easily accessible format many women by choice or by necessity will seek out the women 's health care provider as their source of primary care this third edition of women 's health a primary to clinical guide is designed to help meet the needs of these providers who offer women more than basic reproductive health care it covers the traditional reproductive and gynecologic content as well as selected common medical psychosocial developmental and political problems issues and needs we have updated every chapter and at the request of readers included a new chapter chapter 5 integrating wellness complementary therapies and women 's health to maintain a reasonable length of the book we had to choose a chapter to omit unfortunately since legal issues are covered well in most references on the role of the nurse practitioner we now refer readers to such references for this topic we hope to bring legal issues back in the future in an expanded manner with role and policy components specific to women 's health part i women health and the health care system begins with a chapter on the major historical and contemporary changes in health care relating to women focusing on the important societal economic and political factors that will affect health needs for the end of this century and into the next chapter 2 discusses women 's health and development through the life cycle followed by chapter 3 specific to the adolescent woman

and their impacts on women with insights into related health care needs and therapies are discussed in chapter 23 chapter 24 reviews unique care concerns of women with disabilities and chronic illness the appendices address emergency childbirth appendix a assessment of the newborn appendix b and selected laboratory values commonly referenced in women 's health appendix c we particularly intend this book to be a handbook a resource that allows any primary health care provider to retrieve basic information easily we see it as a reference with enough depth to be useful in a clinical setting serving as a source of teaching advice for clients including differential medical diagnoses screening and early intervention measures and guidelines for referral some of the chapters fit more easily into an outline format for diseases or other conditions whereas many chapters conform to a more traditional text format or a combination format for presentation of issues we wish to remind the reader that the scope of advanced practice nursing varies from state to state and the individual practitioner is responsible for knowing his or her legal limits of practice also recognizing the rapidity with which new knowledge becomes available and standards change the practitioner must stay ever alert women 's health care providers are continuously challenged to expand their knowledge and ability to help women fulfill a wide spectrum of needs both physical and psychosocial women 's health is no longer limited to reproductive organs the broadening scope of women 's health care is a critically important issue in this period of rapidly changing health care systems resources are burgeoning empowering women to become more informed consumers in the health care arena yet attaining holistic care to meet basic needs remains a struggle for many we with the contributing authors hope that you as primary care providers in a rapidly changing world of health care will find this book a useful and an effective resource in your endeavors to provide women with the health care they need and deserve our sincere thanks go to our excellent contributing authors their outstanding expertise and effort have made this book the useful clinical reference we envisioned we also wish to thank the fine editors and staff at prentice hall health and pine tree composition inc. for their support and many hours of
